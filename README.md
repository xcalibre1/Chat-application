# Teleparty Chat Application - Assignment Submission

This document provides an overview of the Teleparty Chat application, its features, architecture, and instructions for running it. This application fulfills the requirements of the assignment by allowing users to create and join chat rooms and exchange messages in real-time using the `teleparty-websocket-lib`.

## Features

* **Create Chat Room:** Users can create a new chat room by providing a nickname. Upon successful creation, they are taken to the chat interface, and a unique Room ID is generated by the Teleparty backend.
* **Join Existing Chat Room:** Users can join an existing chat room by providing a Room ID and a nickname.
* **Real-time Messaging:** Once in a chat room, users can send and receive messages instantly.
* **Message Display:** Chat messages are displayed in a scrollable area, showing the sender's nickname and the message content. System messages (if any) are also displayed.
* **Leave Room:** Users can leave the current chat room and return to the "Join or Create Room" screen.
* **Basic UI:** A simple and intuitive user interface for creating, joining, and participating in chat rooms.
* **Internationalization (Basic):** The application uses a `localeConfig` to manage all user-facing text, making it easier to adapt for different languages in the future.

## Architecture


The application is built using React and leverages the `teleparty-websocket-lib` for handling WebSocket communication with the Teleparty backend. The main components are:

* **`App.tsx`:** The main application component. It manages the overall state, including the current view (join/create or chat), user nickname, current room ID, and the WebSocket client. It also handles the logic for creating and joining rooms and switching between the UI views.
* **`hooks/useTeleparty.ts`:** A custom React Hook that encapsulates the logic for initializing and managing the `TelepartyClient` and handling WebSocket events (connection, disconnection, and receiving messages). It provides the client instance and the list of messages.
* **`JoinOrCreateRoom.tsx`:** This component provides the user interface for either creating a new chat room (by entering a nickname) or joining an existing one (by entering a Room ID and a nickname).
* **`ChatArea.tsx`:** This component displays the chat interface. It shows the current room ID, the list of messages, an input field for typing new messages, and a button to send messages and leave the room.
* **`constant.ts`:** This file contains the `localeConfig` object, which holds all the user-facing text in the application. This is used for basic internationalization.

## Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you received the code this way).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```
3.  **Install the dependencies** using npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** to the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Testing the Application

1.  **Open the application in two separate browser windows or tabs.**
2.  **In the first window (User A):**
    * Enter a nickname in the "Create New Room" section.
    * Click "Create New Room".
    * Note down the Room ID displayed in the chat area.
3.  **In the second window (User B):**
    * Enter a different nickname in the "Join Existing Room" section.
    * Enter the Room ID you noted from User A.
    * Click "Join Room".
4.  **Start chatting!** Messages sent by User A should appear in User B's window, and vice versa.
5.  **Test leaving and rejoining:** Click the "Leave Room" button and then try joining the same or a different room.

## Key Implementation Details

* **State Management:** React's `useState` hook is used to manage component-level state, such as the current view, nickname, room ID, and messages.
* **Custom Hook for WebSocket:** The `useTeleparty` hook handles the complexities of the `TelepartyClient` lifecycle and message handling, providing a cleaner interface for the `App` component.
* **Conditional Rendering:** The `App` component uses conditional rendering based on the `currentView` state to switch between the `JoinOrCreateRoom` and `ChatArea` components.
* **Locale Configuration:** The `constant.ts` file and the `localeConfig` object provide a basic mechanism for managing and potentially translating user-facing text. All hardcoded strings in the UI and alerts have been replaced with values from this configuration.


## Potential Improvements


* **Message History:** (As discussed in the code comments) Implement the retrieval and display of previous messages when a user joins a room, if the Teleparty backend supports this feature.
* **Upload feature:** Allow users to choose/upload a user icon
